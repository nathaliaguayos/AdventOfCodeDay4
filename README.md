# Day 4: Repose Record

 This project is named "Repose_Record" and is based on the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge of [Day 4: Repose Record](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/4), you should now that is a C# solution created in Visual Studio. The Visual Studio solution has 2 projects, the first one is the main project, is where the code to solve the challenge lives, this one is called "Repose_Record", the second one is where the Unit Tests for the main project were created, this is called "Repose_Record_Tests". 



 ## Getting Started

 The project was developed in C# programming language and built-in Visual Studio, please keep reading this file for more details about this solution.


 ### Prerequisites

 About software

 ```
Install Visual Studio 2017
Install Git
```
Once you have installed the previous software, please clone this repo of mine to your local machine. 

 ### Running the project

 Now I'm going to tell you how you can run the application and explain a little the response that you'll receive.  

 1. Open the "Repose_Record" solution. 
2. Select "Program" Class.
3. Notice that the main class is there in this method, and there is an array preconfigured with the values indicated in the [challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/4) as puzzle input. 
4. Click on the "Run" button and you will get a result in the console.

 ## Running the tests

 To run the test is similar to run the application, with a difference that we need to open our "Test Explorer" view, please make sure that you have it opened and then follow the next instructions:

 1. Open the "Repose_Record_Test" project.
2. Notice that there are 2 folders; *Strategy 1* stored the first strategy in the challenge and the second one stored the *Strategy 2*.
3. Select the whatever of the 2 Classes. Notice that inside the class we have some test methods, and each of them have different values to test. 
4. In the Test Explorer window, we can do a right-click over the "Repose_Record_Test" and select "Run the selected Tests".
5. Wait until the Unit Tests run to see the Test results, all of them should be "passed".

 **NOTE:** *I used scenarios similar to the challenge sample to create the unit tests, but those are not the only scenarios, they could be more.
