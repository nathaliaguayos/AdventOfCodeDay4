# Day 2: Inventory Management System

This project is named "InventoryMgmtSystem" and is based on the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge of [Day 2: Inventory Management System](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/2), you should now that is a C# solution created in Visual Studio. The Visual Studio solution has 2 projects, the first one is the main project, is where the code to solve the challenge lives, this one is called "InventoryMgmtSystem", the second one is where the Unit Tests for the main project were created, this is called "InventoryMgmtSystem_Tests". 



## Getting Started

Well, for this project you already know that it is based on a challenge and that it was developed in C# programming language and actually that it was made in Visual Studio. So please keep reading this readme for more details about this solution.


### Prerequisites

About software

```
Install Visual Studio 2017
Install Git
```
Once you have installed the previous software, please clone this repo of mine to your local machine. 

### Running the project

Now I'm going to tell you how you can run the application and explain a little the response that you'll receive.  

1. Open the "InventoryMgmtSystem" solution. 
2. Select "Program" Class.
3. Notice that the main class is there in this method, and there is an array preconfigured with the values indicated in the [challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/2) sample. 
4. Click on the "Run" button and you will get a result in the console for both parts of the challenge.

**Note:** Notice that there are 2 more classes in addition the *Program.cs*. The first one *"InventoryChecksum"* is to solve the first part of the challenge; the second one *"PrototypeFinder"* is to solve the second part. 

## Running the tests

To run the test is similar to run the application, with a difference that we need to open our "Test Explorer" view, please make sure that you have it opened and then follow the next instructions:

1. Open the "InventoryMgmtSystem_Tests" project, notice that there are 2 folders; *InventoryChecksum* which stores the tests for the first part of the challenge and the other is *PrototypeFinder* which contains the tests for the second part.
2. Select whatever of the 2 Classes. Notice that inside the class there are some test methods, and each of them has different values to test. 
3. In the Test Explorer window, we can do a right-click over the "InventoryMgmtSystem_Tests" and select "Run the selected Tests".
4. Wait until the Unit Tests run to see the Test results, all of them should be "passed".


**NOTE:** *I used scenarios similar to the challenge sample to create the unit tests, but those are not the only scenarios, they could be more.
